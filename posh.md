## What kinds of behaviour cause sexual harassment?

Sexual harassment happens when someone makes another person feel uncomfortable or unsafe in a sexual way. This includes unwanted touching, inappropriate comments, repeated advances, sharing explicit content, pressuring for sex, or online harassment. It often comes from ignoring boundaries or misusing power, and preventing it requires respect, clear rules, and consequences.

## What would you do in case you face or witness any incident or repeated incidents of such behaviour?

If I ever face or witness sexual harassment, I will stay calm and take action. If I feel safe, I will speak up and tell the person to stop. I will document the incident with details like the date, time, and what happened. I will report it to a trusted authority, such as a manager, HR, or relevant organization. I will support the victim if I am a witness and encourage them to report it. If the situation is serious or dangerous, I will seek legal help or contact law enforcement.
