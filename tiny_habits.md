## 1. In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?

The most interesting idea I found in this video is that if we want any habit to be included in our daily life, add it after your regular existing daily habit that we do every day in our routine and make it as tiny as possible.

## 2. How can you use B = MAP to make making new habits easier? What are M, A and P ?

I'll celebrate every tiny success in my life so that my motivation(M) and confidence grows high. According to B = MAP (M = motivation, A = ability, P = prompt), if my motivation is high I can do hard task easily. For example I'll celebrate whenever I'll learn a new coding concept. It will increase my confidence even to learn any hard concepts in programming.

## 3. Why it is important to "Shine" or Celebrate after each successful completion of habit? (This is the most important concept in today's topic. Whatever you celebrate becomes a habit)

There are many reasons to "Shine" or celebrate after each success :

- Celebration makes us happy. Happiness makes us feel good to repeat the task again or include the task to be a part of our routine.
- repeating a task alone is harder. celebrations give us an additional punch to repeat the task.
- celebrations build the momentum. It works like a fuel to keep going.

## 5. What is the book's perspective about Identity?

The perspective about Identity is that we should include our habits in our identity rathar than doing it by thinking of the outcomes only.

Instead I can think that I am a healthy person, and that's why I'll have healty food.

I would like to sleep early and wake up early. To make the cue obvious, I can turn off the room's light early and make the environment sleep friendly.
